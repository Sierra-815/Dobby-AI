## Meeting Recordings into Professional Business Minutes
***Save Your Minutes*** provides the best AI solution to convert your meeting recordings into the professional business minutes and transcripts. Once you upload the audio file, you can get the professional minutes and speaker-diarized transcriptions immediately. With the ***Save Your Minutes***-made draft, you can easily add, rearrange and modify your minutes. And then? Everything is done!

## Purpose
