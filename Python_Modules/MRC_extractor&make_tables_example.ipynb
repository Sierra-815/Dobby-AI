So we have two main agendas for today.  Why don't we start with Kim and talk about the first agenda?    Kim  The first thing we need to discuss about is what API we should use.  So I have been searching up APIs and found 5 products, but the ones worth talking about are 2, one made by Google and the other made by IBM. Both of them have pretty much similar quality I think. They can interpret the words well and transcribe them with high accuracy. The bottom line is, Google and IBM works the best.     Erin  Oh I have used Google API before. Isn't it kinda bad? The accuracy is not so great isn't it?     Kim  I think the accuracy and the level of completion is different between the free version and premium paid version. Since we can still use the premium paid version for free during trial period, we should do that.    Erin   Alright then, could you please use the premium version and see how it works out? After that let's select the API and do some coding works to get them to function. You should work with Sierra on that Can we do this by next meeting which we should hold on the 12th?    Kim   Okay, so we have two action items for this. First thing is to evaluate Google Premium API, and i will do that. The next item is to confirm API and edit the code, me, Kim and Sierra will    Erin  Next is Steven, please update us with your interface works, the second agenda for this meeting.     Steven  Well I haven't been very productive with my task so please excuse me. What I did do however is I searched up some already-available services for Ai automated transcription services. There were two that I found to be somewhat relevant to what we were doing: Otter.ai and Deeptalk. Fortunately both of them have yet developed ways to produce meeting notes or minute so if we can get it done, we would be the first to do so. I will get the interface design by today and the rest of the work including homepage feedback by the next meeting on the 12th.    Erin   alright. Steven will have two tasks for the second agenda. First one is to get the interface design by today. Second is to give some Homepage feedback by the next meeting.  \"\r\n",

        "#full=\"2021.02.14. 16:03  Erin  Hi everyone, We're starting 3rd KIC Project Progress Check meeting.  The attendees of today's meeting are Erin, Kim, Steven, Sierra, Koo, and Jeon.   Shall we begin our meeting?  So we have two main agendas for today.  Why don't we start with Kim and talk about the first agenda?    Kim  The first thing we need to discuss about is what API we should use.  So I have been searching up APIs and found 5 products, but the ones worth talking about are 2, one made by Google and the other made by IBM. Both of them have pretty much similar quality I think. They can interpret the words well and transcribe them with high accuracy. The bottom line is, Google and IBM works the best.     Erin  Oh I have used Google API before. Isn't it kinda bad? The accuracy is not so great isn't it?     Kim  I think the accuracy and the level of completion is different between the free version and premium paid version. Since we can still use the premium paid version for free during trial period, we should do that.    Erin   Alright then, could you please use the premium version and see how it works out? After that let's select the API and do some coding works to get them to function. You should work with Sierra on that Can we do this by next meeting which we should hold on the 12th?    Kim   Okay, so we have two action items for this. First thing is to evaluate Google Premium API, and i will do that. The next item is to confirm API and edit the code, me, Kim and Sierra will    Erin  Next is Steven, please update us with your interface works, the second agenda for this meeting.     Steven  Well I haven't been very productive with my task so please excuse me. What I did do however is I searched up some already-available services for Ai automated transcription services. There were two that I found to be somewhat relevant to what we were doing: Otter.ai and Deeptalk. Fortunately both of them have yet developed ways to produce meeting notes or minute so if we can get it done, we would be the first to do so. I will get the interface design by today and the rest of the work including homepage feedback by the next meeting on the 12th.\"\r\n",

Both of them have pretty much similar quality I think. They can interpret the words well and transcribe them with high accuracy. The bottom line is, Google and IBM works the best.  <br>  <br> Erin Oh I have used Google API before. Isn't it kinda bad? The accuracy is not so great isn't it?  <br>  <br> Kim I think the accuracy and the level of completion is different between the free version and premium paid version. Since we can still use the premium paid version for free during trial period, we should do that. <br>  <br> Erin Alright then, could you please use the premium version and see how it works out? After that let's select the API and do some coding works to get them to function. You should work with Sierra on that Can we do this by next meeting which we should hold on the 12th? <br>  <br> Kim Okay, so we have two action items for this. First thing is to evaluate Google Premium API, and i will do that. The next item is to confirm API and edit the code, me, Kim and Sierra will <br>  <br> Erin Next is Steven, please update us with your interface works, the second agenda for this meeting.  <br>  <br> Steven Well I haven't been very productive with my task so please excuse me. What I did do however is I searched up some already-available services for Ai automated transcription services. There were two that I found to be somewhat relevant to what we were doing: Otter.ai and Deeptalk. Fortunately both of them have yet developed ways to produce meeting notes or minute so if we can get it done, we would be the first to do so. I will get the interface design by today and the rest of the work including homepage feedback by the next meeting on the 12th. <br>  <br> Erin alright. Steven will have two tasks for the second agenda. First one is to get the interface design by today. Second is to give some Homepage feedback by the next meeting. <br> \"\r\n",
