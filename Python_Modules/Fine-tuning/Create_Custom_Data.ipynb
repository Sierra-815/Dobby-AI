Jared, you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan. Is there anybody else who knows what's in here at the moment, block by block? Eric Dale. And where is he? As of today, he's no longer with the firm. We have been trying to locate him. Carmelo. Yes. Get me Eric Dale here by 6:33. It's done. We meet back here in an hour.\",\n",
