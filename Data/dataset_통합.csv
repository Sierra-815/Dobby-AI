"Honey, I’m home.
How was your day?
Alright. Hey, did you order something? There’s a large box outside the door.
It’s the tent we bought online for our camping trip. I’m returning it.
Is it because of the size? I remember you said it might be a little small to fit
all of us.
Actually, when I set up the tent, it seemed big enough to hold us all.
Then, did you find a cheaper one on another website?
No, price is not the issue.
Then, why are you returning the tent?
It’s too heavy to carry around. We usually have to walk a bit to get to the
campsite.
I see. Is someone coming to pick up the box?
Yes. I already scheduled a pickup.",why does he want to take the tent back? ,too heavy to carry around,meeting_1,113

"As you probably know,
over the last 36 to 41 months
the firm has begun packaging
new MBS products that combine
several different tranches
of rating classifications
in one tradable security.
This has been
enormously profitable,
as I imagine you noticed.
I have.
The firm is currently doing
a considerable amount
of this business every day.
Now, the problem, which is, I
guess, why we are here tonight,
is that is takes us,
the firm, about a month
to layer these products correctly,
thereby posing a challenge
from a Risk Management
standpoint.
And, Mr. Sullivan,
that challenge is?
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to.
Yes.
But the key factor here is these
are essentially just mortgages.
So that has allowed us to push
the leverage considerably beyond
what you might be willing or allowed
to do in any other circumstance,
thereby pushing the risk profile
without raising any red flags.
Now... Thank you,
Mr. Sullivan. Sit down.
What I'm guessing your
report here says,
and give me some rope here.
What I'm guessing it says is that
considering the, shall we say,
bumpy road we've been on

that the figures your brilliant co-workers

this has already happened?
Sort of.
And, Mr. Sullivan, what does your model
say that, that means for us here.
Well, that's where it
becomes a projection.
But...
You're speaking with
me, Mr. Sullivan.
Well, sir,
if those assets
decrease by just 25%
and remain on our books,
that loss would be greater than
the current market capitalization
of this entire company.
So, what you're telling me
is that the music
is about to stop
and we're going to be left
holding the biggest bag
of odorous excrement
ever assembled
in the history of
capitalism.
Sir, I'm not sure that I would put it
that way. But let me clarify.
Using your analogy,
what this model shows
is the music, so to
speak, just slowing.
If the music were to
stop, as you put it,
then this model wouldn't be
even close to that scenario.
It would be
considerably worse.
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Sullivan.
Do you care to know why I'm
in this chair with you all?
I mean, why I earn
the big bucks?
Yes.
I'm here for one reason
and one reason alone.
I'm here to guess what the music might
do a week, a month, a year from now.

Don’t worry. It’s really very easy. First of all, use the red button here to switch it on and off. The green button puts the projector on standby, which is very convenient for presentations. These blue arrows here control the color and the brightness of the image and then there’s this little wheel here. If you turn the wheel towards you, the image gets bigger, and if you turn it away from you, the image gets smaller.
Okay, that looks easy!

"Can we please get back to work and send the Hardy Boys to their room? Neal, tell them. After an explosion like that, the first thing that's supposed to happen is the underwater blowout preventer should automatically close. The flames are still 150 feet high, so that obviously didn't happen.

" So if you think about this, it's kind of like a shortcut. They're using gender as a shortcut to get to their target consumer. The issue is that as logical as that argument seems, gender as a shortcut is actually not great. In this day and age, if you still blindly use a gender view for your marketing activities, actually it's just plain bad business. I'm not talking even about the backlash on stereotypes in advertising, which is a very real thing that has to be addressed. I'm saying it's bad business because you're leaving money on the table for your brands and your products. Because gender is such an easy thing to find in the market and to target and to talk about, it actually distracts you from the fun things that could be driving growth from your brands and, at the same time, it continues to create separation around genders and perpetuate stereotypes.

I'm saying it's bad business because you're leaving money on the table for your brands and your products. Because gender is such an easy thing to find in the market and to target and to talk about, it actually distracts you from the fun things that could be driving growth from your brands and, at the same time, it continues to create separation around genders and perpetuate stereotypes. So at the same time this activity is bad for your business and bad for society, so double whammy. And gender is one of those things like other demographics that have historically been good marketing shortcuts. ",What is her opinion on gender as a shortcut?,actually not great,meeting_41,191
"So at this point, I know, suspense is not killing you, because I told you what the output is, but what we found over time is after 200 projects around the world -- this is covering 20 countries or more -- in essence we ran about a hundred thousand of these tournaments, and, no surprise, gender was very rarely the most predictive thing to understand consumer needs. From a hundred thousand tournaments, gender only came out as the winning variable in about five percent of them. This is true around the world, by the way. We did this in places where traditional gender roles are a little more pronounced, and the conclusions were exactly the same. It was a little bit more important, gender, than five percent, but not material. So let's let that sink in for a second. No matter how you're looking at a consumer, most likely anything else is going to be more interesting to you than gender. There's probably something very important you need to know about them, and you're getting distracted because you're doing everything based on gender.",What did they find over time?,gender was very rarely the most predictive thing to understand consumer needs.,meeting_42,183

If you're a food company, for example, it's actually much more interesting to you to know where people are eating, who they are eating with, are they very nutritionally oriented.

If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit, why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit? We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them, probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars. I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point. But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them, find enough investors that this can be considered a success, there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring.

"I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change; and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. They're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. Recently, the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries. They wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic, and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers from 113 countries. It's a big community; such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. Every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño Oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I study.

"The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene. But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system. Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car. But still, we look at the pieces. We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. It takes weeks to perform our integrations, and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening. We also fly all over the world looking for this thing.

With all due respect, Governor, they're not your citizens. They're mine and it's my job to protect them.

It's a job you have no business doing.

Well, not according to the Constitution. Governor, you should also know that your police unknowingly picked up three undercover operatives working on a long lead investigation for Homeland Security.

I can't give you their names because it's classified and you don't have clearance. That is why I need you to release everybody that you've picked up today.

Well, I'm not gonna do that.

Well, then, Governor, you'll be obstructing a federal investigation. I'm sure you're aware of the consequences for that. 

Look, I'm just trying to keep my people safe. 

How safe is Danny Fayad this evening? Governor, I need your answer now.

I'll call the State Police, tell them to stand down and release everyone we've picked up.

Thank you.

(SIGHS)

Mr. President, would you like me to contact Homeland Security, tell them their agents have been released?

There were no agents. It was a bluff.

A band-aid to stop the bleeding for now.

Well done, Mr. President.",When will the next meeting be held?,,meeting_47,254
"If you want this job so much, why didn't you just go to law school?

When I was in college, it was my dream to be a lawyer. I needed some money and Trevor convinced me to memorize this math test and sell it. Turns out we sold it to the dean's daughter. I lost my scholarship, I got kicked out of school, I… I got knocked into a different life. And I have been wishing for a way back ever since.

Let me tell you something. This isn't elementary school. This is hard work. Long hours. High pressure. I need a grown goddamn man.

You give me this, and I will work as hard as it takes to school those Harvard douches and become the best lawyer you have ever seen.

I'm inclined to give you a shot but what if I decide to go another way?

I'd say that's fair. 

Sometimes, I like to hang out with people who aren't that bright. You know, just to see how the other half lives. Move over. I'm emailing the firm we've just found our next associate. All right. You're going to start a week from Monday. Here's what you're going to do. First, no more pot. We drug test. Stop smoking now, you'll be fine.

MIKE: How did you know that?

HARVEY: You read books, I read people.

And pot-heads smoke pot.That's what they do.

That's not all I do. I have interests.",When will the job start?,Going to start a week from Monday,meeting_48,234
