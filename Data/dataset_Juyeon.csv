2,"Hey, Mark and Floyd. Did you guys see the memo about the upcoming changes to the travel expense policy?
Yes, Samantha. I'm glad the company has decided to increase the amount that employees will be reimbursed for transportation to $5,000 per trip.
That'll really help when booking flights for business trips.
Don't you think it's a bit high? On my last business trip, I didn't spend more than $5,000 per trip. I didn't spend more than $1,600 for all my travel expenses.

3,"Ms. Ellison, is it possible for us to get new computer monitors for the office? The graphic designers say the resolution quality of our current computer screens is rather poor. It seems to negatively impact their work.
I've been meaning to do that for quite a while. We couldn't afford to upgrade in the past, but we have enough funds this month. I'll ask the office manager to order high-resolution monitors for all our designers.
They will certainly appreciate that. And if you're unsure about which models to get, I can ask the staff for their opinions on the matter.",What does the graphic designer say?,the resolution quality of our current computer screens is rather poor
